# Background Image

## Placeholder Notice

The file `site-sea.jpg` should be placed in this directory (`/public/images/site-sea.jpg`).

**Current Status**: Image file not yet added. The site will use a gradient fallback until the image is provided.

## Requirements

- **File name**: `site-sea.jpg`
- **Recommended specs**: 
  - High resolution (1920x1080 minimum, 2560x1440 preferred)
  - Ocean/sea photography with blue tones
  - JPG format optimized for web (quality: 85-90%)
  - File size: under 500KB if possible

## How to Add

1. Obtain or create an ocean/sea photograph
2. Optimize the image (compress if needed)
3. Save as `site-sea.jpg` in this directory
4. The site will automatically use it (no code changes needed)

## Fallback Behavior

Until the image is added, the site will display a beautiful ocean-blue gradient that maintains the visual aesthetic.
